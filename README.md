**Practo prescription reader**

Practo is a health related website that I and many others visit. Every time after a consultation, doctors provide a prescription in form of an image, from which I have to figure out what the medicines are, and then order them online. I have tried to short circuit this process by removing me from most of the processing.

Used technologies:
1. python
2. opencv: to detect text
3. selenium: For web automation
